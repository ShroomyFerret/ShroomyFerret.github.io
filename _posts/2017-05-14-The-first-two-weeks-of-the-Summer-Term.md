The first two weeks of the Summer Term - IT Lessons

	This term we're starting CODEACADEMY. Now I know we would be doing CODEACADEMY sometime soon as my brother who went to and still is in this school, did it and made me an account many moons ago, though I did HTML and CSS, not Python, as we are doing now.

	It seems that Python can be used in After Effects and other programmes. We started with learning booleans and other calculation symbols - + - * / - using it is challenging and sometimes the instructions can be confusing. But a challenge is always good fun. Working through them with Finn is competitive and fun going through the lessons - you might get a badge - like so:

	I'll write again for next week!

	Bye
