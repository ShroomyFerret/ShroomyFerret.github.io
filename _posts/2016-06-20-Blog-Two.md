**Blog Two**

**The Plan Change!**

Today sir said that three were not allowed in a team, quite unfair but he does have a good point. If there are more than two people to a team then the chance of somebody doing nothing is quite high.

I am now paired up with Morgan and our new game plan is to guess what the microbit is thinking. It will give you a 5 clues in succession and if you haven't guessed what it was thinking by then, you lose.

Well that's it for now, next Friday Iâ€™ll have the news on the next lessons.
