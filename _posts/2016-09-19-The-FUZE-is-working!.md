    <td>We went on with our coding and this time I started typing and Finn reading. We were show binary in more depth than before and it was great fun creating a space invader. We were shown how the ones and zeros added up but I had already been taught all this.</td>

    <td>We didn't encounter any problems with our coding and it was all smooth sailing. Sir also showed us JV BIN, which is a useful website for testing your Javascript coding.</td>

    <td>As I said, we didn’t encounter any problems and so don’t have anything to change. All we need to do, (in my opinion) is carry on doing what we have been doing so far.</td>
