    <td>Not Sure, just listen to the candidate.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>In Hindsight we really couldn't exactly not listen to the candidate now could we?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Well, I mean, like I said before, I couldn't exactly fail this lesson’s target, we just had to sit and keep our attention on the candidate for teaching at the school. He taught us more about solving problems and the different steps and terminologies that were to do with it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Um, I guess that sir’s accent was slightly confusing, slightly, that’s it really.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Um, well next time there’s a teacher being considered and I’m in the lesson I don’t think I would do much differently, I took notes and listened, well um yeah.</td>
