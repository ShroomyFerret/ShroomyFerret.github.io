    <td>Today sir gave us instructions on how to improve the borders of the tables in my blog posts' tables. We then went on to do this but mine doesn’t seem to work. I had an experimentation with it and proof checked to code and so I have to go through it at home again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>When I copied the work from google classroom to my code I think it pasted into an unintended area as I think the same thing has been pasted twice and thus broken the code. I also think this because the said the error is at  the end of the text about table at the bottom so the dopple-ganger text may be further up.</td>
