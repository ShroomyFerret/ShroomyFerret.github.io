(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Came in. Got the equipment. Got started. Me and Finn took it in turns but we were still a bit behind everybody else. We still need to catch up but with the fact that one person was instructing at the same speed, if that person went too fast the exact details would be lost.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>We needed to be faster, especially if we don't want to be the last to finish, let alone catch everyone else up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I’ll try and speed up and get a bit more done, there isn’t much but I may want to just go over how to set up the fuse as I’m not too sure but I think I have the general idea.</td>
