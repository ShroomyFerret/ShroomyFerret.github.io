    <td>Since I was alone for the first half of this lesson it took more time for me to read the text and type rather than hearing it and typing it at the same time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Finn not being there, and the actual code that I was coding seemed to be having a problem with my code and it was really hard to find out what it was. When Finn did come back to the lesson we managed to fix it. Me and Finn also found it hard to just work as a pair again but hopefully, as he should be here at the beginning of next lesson.</td>

    <td>I should probably read through the text a bit more thoroughly to make sure I don't miss anything. And me ad Finn should probably work better as a team.</td>
