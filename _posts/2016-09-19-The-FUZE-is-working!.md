  <tr>
    <td>Me and Finn took in turn to read out the code and the other typed it up - I found this really helpful and avoided any fuss - which is always appreciated when you're trying to make up for lost time!
We learnt about variables today.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited us today - we got working straight away and got the Fuse up and running, nothing hindered our learning or went wrong, which is absolutely marvelous! </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I said, we really didn't have any abhorrent hindrances and so our learning went smoothly, the only thing to improve on that I can think of is how that when we were coding, we sometimes missed spaces and that affected the output text.</td>
