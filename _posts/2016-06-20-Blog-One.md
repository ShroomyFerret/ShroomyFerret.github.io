**Blog One **

**Very Late in the Year**

This is the first blog I have ever done. This particular blog refers to the first Computing lesson I had after the summer half term.

In the lesson we were making plans for games we would be making on BBC microbit.

Our game - this includes me, Finn and Will in my team - is about one light dodging a 'shower' of other lights.

I shall update you on the going ons of our plan in the next blog! n.n
