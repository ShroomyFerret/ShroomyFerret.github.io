Blog 5

We had a cover teacher for today's lesson, it was fine, nothing extraordinary happened, I finished another section in my PYTHON work, and am progressing yet still at the heels of my classmates, who are terabytes ahead of me. (fine, that may of been an exaggeration but it was still a good computer pun. But if you don't agree, you can *pun*ish me, okay! Sorry, I'll stop now!) 

The blog itself has been renovated, with an adorable teal blue vine design, yet it clashes with my writing so that will need to be fixed.

Anyway, I'll write next time, Amal
