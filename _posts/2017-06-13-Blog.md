Blog Post 4

This lesson we did more work on strings and outputs. I had to do more activities on this topic. Some were relatively easy while some I needed some helpline help from Finn.

Some were challenging but satisfying to do and I am having a lot of fun with it. Python is a really interesting language to learn and seeing how it applies to other things is also really interesting. I achieved my goals of furthering into Python yet I am still woefully behind certain classmates and certainly need to catch up.

I'll write next time!
