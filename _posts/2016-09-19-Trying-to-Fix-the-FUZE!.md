    <td>Finn wasn't in the lesson for reasons beyond me, for half of the lesson. I  carried on with the FUZE but as it was Finn who normally plugs in the wires, I had to ask for a bit of help but I knew how to set up most of the FUZE.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It was hard to work faster on my own as I couldn’t type while hearing but had to keep on looking down at the text. But other than that, there was no hindrance and even this once went when Finn appeared. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Remembering how to set up the FUZE would be useful. Working faster and that’s it really, everything else is going smoothly for now.
