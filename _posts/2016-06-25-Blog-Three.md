**Blog Three**

A lesson on discrimination and other social issues, not your everyday I.T lesson. We started the lesson by doing a survey on discrimination and how we treat each other in school.

Sir lectured us on how the use of the 'N' word and the word rape and gay are unforgivably horrible to use.

I found that I would be going to Oxford for a treasure hunt for my enrichment day,

We finished the day by doing some more work on our game plans.

I'll write back soon!
