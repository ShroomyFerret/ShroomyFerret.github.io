Blog post summary blogs part ½!

This new section of our computing lessons in our IT/Drama period is being taught by Mr Tansley. It's a nice change as we have only ever been taught by Mr Keen.

We're starting to use Python with turtle, this is continuing with our work on coding but we now have a visual output. We started making simple shapes and the theory of making a circle over the first few weeks, we then went  onto trying to make our initials. This works by us coding in instructions for our turtle to move forward and turn a certain degree left or right, it all boils down to math and just lots of calculations. My initials are A.S and the A was easy (remember: it has to be 3D) but making the S a proportionate size was very difficult and though I decided to make it curvy instead of blocky, I couldn’t shrink the size down.

Afterwards we tried to create patterns and with colours and code we found online, making pretty flower-esque shapes shapes that merged colours, creating an optical illusion of sorts.

I could of spent more time on my initials but what we did next was very exciting and moving on to that seemed more appropriate...
