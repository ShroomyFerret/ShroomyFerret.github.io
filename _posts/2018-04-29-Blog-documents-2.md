Blog post summary blogs part 2/2!

The new exciting thing that we have started on python with turtle are quizzes! We have started to code codes akin to BuzzFeed quizzes, How Posh are You? What Cat Breed are You?

I started with coding a mini Pokemon based game that would of taken way too long but I had found another better idea. This was based of trying to find out what breed of cat you are.

This is still ongoing, I have a large amount of cat breeds that I am setting attributes to, as people answer questions, a numerical value is added to their answer which adds up to equal a score, It will be quite complicated but possible, and I hope it works.

It is not ready yet but when it is I hope it is marvellous.
