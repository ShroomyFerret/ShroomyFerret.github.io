The 3rd Blog Post

This week I worked on creating the format for date and time on PYTHON. It felt very satisfying to understand the theory behind the code and then see how malleable it is and open to change. And even though this change is changing the order is still felt very freeing. Changing the format from American to English, I can't quite place my finger on why but it just *is *satisfying.

Anyway, enough gibberish - I earned some more badges including one for 'strings and console output' which was another topic that I went through in the lesson. The lesson was as usual, very calm and methodical working through the exercises.

I'll write for next week

Bye!
