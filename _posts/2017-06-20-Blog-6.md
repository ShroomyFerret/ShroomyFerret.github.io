Blog 6

Today I did a lot more work on Pyg Latin, which I changed to Boar Latin for amusement, I far prefer boars to pigs. This is how Pyg - sorry I mean Boar Latin works: you take the first letter of your subject word and put it at the end - like so: Pyg = Ygp - you then add the suffix 'ay' at the end: Ygp = Ygpay.

Our translator has to make sure that the word put in is a real word and thus doesn't have any numbers in - or that they subject is did put a word in at all. It’s deeply satisfying getting this work right for some odd reason though I am finding it a lot easier than most of my exploits in coding. Though it isn’t overly challenging, it wasn’t ridiculously easy either, it was a satisfying topic to work through - which is thoroughly needed on this boiling summers day which is slowly wearing down my tolerance to the sun.

	DRAT YOU GLOBAL WARMING! Though think of the polar bears and what they have to go through…

I fixed the blog font as well. From an unreadable white to a stark magenta.

Well I'll see you soon - Bye!!
